IF this directory exists, the PGP addon will use keyfiles
 pubring.pkr and secring.skr stored here, INSTEAD of your normal
 default PGP keyfiles (keyfiles will be created if they dont exist).

This can be useful if you have an existing installation of PGP and
 dont want to use your normal PGP keyfiles for mircryption.

You can also copy your existing keyfiles in here.
