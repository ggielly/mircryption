ENCRYPT [network~]password :#channel or nick
--------------------------------------------
Encrypt encrypts talk to a channel or person. This is thought
for allowing improved privacy on irc. You need to handshake
a key with the person you want to talk to encrypted, then
both sides have to set that key to encrypt and decrypt correctly.
Example: 
/ENCRYPT v1s1t0r :john
If john would also set the same password to your nick, you could 
talk encrypted. As encryption algorithms blowfish and idea are used.
If you are using ENCRYPT for a channel, then all people on the channel
have to set the same password.
Example:
/ENCRYPT d0ntkn0w :#leet
----
New mircryption/blow/fish style encryption:
You can invoke new encryption modes compatible with
 the mircryption/fish/blow irc addons by specifying a new key prefix
 of 'mcps;' or 'cbc;'
Example:
 /ENCRYPT mcps;test :#mircryption
 /ENCRYPT cbc;test :#mircryptioncbc
If no prefix is used, default psyBNC encryption will be assumed.
