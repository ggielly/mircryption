1.0 WA Link mIRC script general information
    
    The WA Link script has a main alias called /wa, some alias may be called without using 
    the /wa alias. This script runs on a DLL named WA_Link.DLL, so if you do not have this 
    file the script will not work as intended. To make the script fully functional you have 
    to have the /dll function unlocked.  /run is not required to be unlocked but some 
    commands need it so they will not work if you have /run locked.  All pop-ups use the 
    /wa command to execute so you do not need to use the pop-ups if you do not want to.  
    All the dialogs also use the /wa command, the dialogs are infact nothing more than a more 
    user friendly way to use WA_Link.  In conclusion:  Everything you can do with
    a pop-up or dialog you can do with a /wa command.

1.1 mIRC Scripting

    mIRC scripting tutorials can be found on many webpages.  A good to start is on 
    www.scriptaz.com , www.mircscripts.org or www.irc-source.com. Also try looking for 
    "mIRC scripting tutorials" on the web.
    This file will not teach you how to create a script for mIRC.

    TIP! It's a good idea to write your addons in a seprate *.mrc file so you can send it 
    to us and we can put it up on our website. (base@base.is). If you on the other hand
    enhance the original WA_Link script (WA_Link.mrc) feel free to send it to us and earn
    your place in the credits. But please comment what parts you made/modified 
    so we can review it.

2.0 Calling WA Link DLL exported functions from mIRC

    To call a function from DLL it must be exported first, WA Link exported functions are
    listed in section 6.1 WA Link DLL Exported functions
    The function to call a DLL function, is /dll <filename> <procname> [data] or $dll(filename, procname, data) if
    it returns some data.

    Example:

    /dll wa_link\wa_link.dll WA_Link_Command START
    The above line starts WinAMP

    Some functions might return a value. Check 2.1 to 2.6 for more info on the function you 
    want to call.

2.1 WA_Link_Stats

    $dll(<path-to-wa_link.dll>, WA_Link_Stats, <path-to-theme.ini>) returns the appropriate 
    statusline according to the theme or -1 (WinAMP not running).
    To call stats using the default theme (In our example it is located in c:\mirc\wa_link\themes\)
    you could use the following: 
    set %WA.Result $dll(wa_link\wa_link.dll,WA_Link_Stats,c:\mirc\wa_link\themes\default.ini)
    %WA.Result now holds the stats according to the theme. (In this case default.ini)
    And to spit the info out you need a command. i.e. /say %WA.Result
  
2.2 WA_Link_Command

    WA_Link_Command is the function called to control Winamp.
    We use: set %WA.result $dll(<path-to-wa_link.dll>, WA_Link_Command, <command>) , and then
    we check the variable to see if the command was successful.  The variable contains:
    -1 - Winamp is not running, obviously no winamp command can be executed (except /wa start and /wa raw wadir).
    -2 - This is only used with the find command, it means that the track was not found, 
         neither ID3 tag nor filename

    The list of commands follows, commands excluded are the script only commands,
    the only commands that are listed are the ones that need a call to the DLL directly:

      WRITEPL  - Makes WinAMP write the default playlist, since the automation of this 
                 event is only when WinAMP quits.
      PLAYLIST - Toggles the playlist on/off.
      SHADE    - Toggles shade mode on/off.
      PLSHADE  - Toggles playlist shade mode on/off.
      EQ       - Toggles the equalizer window on/off.
      OPEN     - Opens the WinAMP openfile dialog.
      MINIMIZE - Minimizes WinAMP.
      RESTORE  - Restrores a minimized WinAMP.  It does not work with hide.
      SHOW     - Shows a hidden WinAMP.  It does not restore a minimized WinAMP.
      HIDE     - Hides WinAMP.  This is not the same thing as minimize.
      ONTOP    - Toggles WinAMP stay-ontop on/off.
      JUMP     - Jumps to a track number and starts playing.
      FIND     - Searches for a track.  Returns -2 if not found.  This command does not 
                 start playing the track. The scripts alias just simulates it.
      EOFPL    - Jumps to the last track in the playlist. (Short for End Of PlayList)
      BOFPL    - Jumpt to the first track in the playlist. (Short for Beginning Of PlayList)
      NEXT     - Jumps to the next track in the playlist.
      PREV     - Jumps to the previous track in the playlist.
      PAUSE    - Pauses or resumes playing.
      PLAY     - Starts playing or resumes playing.
      STOP     - Stops playing alltogether.
      FADESTOP - Fades the volume down and then stops playing.
      FFW5     - Skips forward 5 seconds. (Short for Fast Forward 5sec)
      REW5     - Skips backward 5 seconds. (Short for Rewind 5sec)
      SEEK     - This command needs to be called with a value.  Skips to a percentage into the track.
      VOL      - This command needs to be called with a value.  Sets the volume to a percentage.
      PAN      - This command needs to be called with a value.  Sets the panning, -100 being left, 
                 0 being center and 100 being right.
      SHUFFLE  - Toggles shuffle or random if you will, on/off.  Raw command can be used to check 
                 if it is toggled on or off.
      REPEAT   - Toggles repeat on/off. Raw command can be used to check if it is toggled on or off.
      VISPLUG  - Starts or stops the selected visualization plug-in.
      CLOSE    - Closes WinAMP.
      START    - Starts/Opens WinAMP.

2.3 WA_Link_Raw_Stats

    The RAW command contained in the script is only a *DEMO* to show you what can be done.  
    Of course you could write your own alias that manipulates the info in some way (see section 5.0).  
    You could for example write an alias that posts to your active window the states 
    of Shuffle and Repeat.

    The command is: set %WA.result $dll(<path-to-wa_link.dll>, WA_Link_Raw_Stats, <command>)

    The raw commands all return $false if the info was not found or WinAMP is not running (except for WADIR).
    The raw commands are listed below:

      SAMPLERATE    - Returns the samplerate of the current track in kHz 
                        (e.g 11, 22 or 44). 1 Kilohertz (kHz) is equal to 1000 cycles per second.
      CHANNELS      - Returns the number of channels 1 being mono 2 being stereo.
      TRACKSIZE     - Returns the physical size of the current track in bytes. 
                        (8 Bits = 1 Byte, 1 Kilebyte = 1024 bytes, 1 Megabyte = 1048576 Bytes) 
      BITRATE       - Returns the bitrate the track was recorded at, in kbps. (Kilobytes per Second)
      GETSHUFFLE    - Returns the state of shuffle. $SHUFFLE_OFF is off, $SHUFFLE_ON is on.
      GETREPEAT     - Returns the state of repeat. $REPEAT_OFF is off, $REPEAT_ON is on.
      WADIR         - Returns the directory of WinAMP.  The default playlist is located in this 
                      folder named winamp.m3u.  This is the only RAW command that can be executed with winamp not running.
      VERSION       - Returns the version of WinAMP.
      STATE         - Returns the state of WinAMP.  
                        $WA_PLAYING    - WinAMP is playing a track.
                        $WA_PAUSED     - WinAMP is paused.
                        $WA_STOPPED    - WinAMP is not playing anything.
                        $WA_NOTRUNNING - WinAMP is not running.
      TRACKSEC      - Returns the length of current track in seconds.  
                        60sec = 1min, 3600sec = 60min = 1hour.
                        This does not work as the theme variable %SECLEN.
                        The theme variable %SECLEN is seconds past the last minute, so if the 
                        track is 1min and 2sec, the theme variable is set to 2.
                        TRACKSEC is the entire track in seconds, so if the track is 
                        the same as above it would return 62.
      POSSEC        - Returns the current position in the current track in seconds.  
                      Also known as seconds played.  This is similar to the TRACKSEC command.
      TRACKNO       - Returns the number of the current playing track.
      TRACKFILENAME - Returns the full path to the current playing track.
      FILETYPE      - Returns the type of file playing, also known as extension.
      TITLE         - Returns the title of the current playing track.
      ARTIST        - Returns the artist of the current playing track.
      ALBUM         - Returns the album of the current playing track.
      YEAR          - Returns the year of the current playing track.
      COMMENT       - Returns the comment of the current playing track.
      GENRE         - Returns the genre of the current playing track.


2.4 WA_Link_About  

    /dll $shortfn($mircdirWA_Link\WA_Link.dll) WA_Link_About

    This command pop-ups a small about dialog.  With information about version and stuff.  
    You can use this info to check what DLL version you have.
   
2.5 LoadDll 

    When you use the /dll or the $dll command this function is automatically executed.  
    This function tells mIRC whether to unload the DLL automatically or keep it in memory.
    In this particular DLL, it is not kept in memory.
          
2.6 UnloadDll

    If the DLL is not kept in memory it is unloaded automatically, so you do not need to worry 
    about it.  The WA_Link DLL is NOT kept in memory so as soon as the function is run 
    (Or command if you will), it unloads itself automatically.  if the DLL were kept in memory this
    is where you would clean up stuff.

3.0 Calling aliases from WA_Link mIRC script
     
    Some features don't call the WA_Link.dll directly, Following is a list of those aliases:

    PLADDD   - Does not actually call the DLL but it calls WinAMP, used to add a directory.
               This command parses the chosen directory and adds *.MP3, *.WMA, *.WAV, *.CDA and *.MID files
               to the playlist.
    PLADDF   - Does not actually call the DLL but it calls WinAMP, used to add a single file.
               Since this is a single file, the extension is irrelevant.
    PLADD    - Does not actually call the DLL but it calls WinAMP, used to add files, seperated by "
               This command can be called with relevant path or full path, so the extension is irrelevant.

    CMD      - View or change the current WA_Link Stats command.  If no parameter is sent along 
               you get the current command, else it is sent to the parameter.

    VIEWPL   - Displays a saved playlist.  This alias calls the SavePl itself so you do not need to 
               save it seperately.

    SAVEPL   - Saves the default winamp playlist into the WA_Link folder under the name Playlist.txt  
               If you change this file, you are NOT changing the actual winamp playlist itself, and 
               if you change the default playlist this file is not updated, you have to resave the 
               playlist to get the up-to-date playlist.

    THEME    - This command requires an additional parameter:
               LIST           - Displays all available themes.
               SET X          - Sets the current theme to X.  You do not specify path, but extension is required.
               SET RANDOM     - Returns $true if the random theme feature is on else it returns $false.
               SET RANDOM 0/1 - Sets the random theme feature on/off (1=on 0=off)

    README   - This command displays the readme in a custom window, so you do not need /run to be 
               unlocked for this to work, even though other commands might require it.

    Most all commands need to be called from within the /wa alias.  E.g: /wa readme
    All commands can be called from the /wa alias, so it is safer to do so, since they might call other aliases
    to work properly.
    It is safe to say that all commands are a part of the /wa alias with very few exceptions.

3.1 WA_Link mIRC script varibles

    Name:                - Default value and description
    ----------------------------------------------------

    %WA.Preview.FileName - c:\mirc\wa_link\themes\Default.INI
                           This is the fullname of the theme to make the previewer work.  
                           Most of the time this is the same as %WA.Theme, but may not always be so. This changes when a 
                           new theme is selected in the combo-box in the wa_link-themes dialog.

    %WA.Preview          - Winamp (%VERSION) is playing(Title: %TITLE)(Artist: %ARTIST)(Album: %ALBUM)(Year: %YEAR)(Genre: %GENRE)(Comment: %COMMENT)(Length: %MINLEN:%SECLEN done with %PERCENT% [|||||-----])
                           This is the preview line sent to the preview window.

    %WA.Theme            - c:\mirc\wa_link\themes\Default.INI
                           This is the fullname of the current chosen theme.

    %WA.Theme.ShortName  - Default
                           This is the short name of the current theme (Path and extension stripped away), this is needed 
                           to select the correct theme in the combobox when opening the theme dialog.

    %WA.Theme.Random     - $false
                           This simply tells whether WA_Link should use a random theme when 
                           displaying stats.

    %WA.Stats.Command    - /say
                           This is the command executed when displaying winamp stats.
    
4.0 Winamp default playlist format

    First line : #EXTM3U
    Second line: #EXTINF:track length in seconds, Track Info
    Third line : Full-path to the track

    The second and third line are repeated for each track in the playlist.  If WinAMP is not set to 
    read tags upon loading, then the playlist may seem incomplete since all or some #EXTINF lines may be missing, 
    but they are either read when visible in the playlist or when the track is played.

    A sample playlist that contains only 3 tracks might look as follows: 

    #EXTM3U
    #EXTINF:1460,Orbital - The Girl With The Sun In Her Head
    K:\Media\Music\Orbital - In Sides\01-The Girl With The Sun In Her Head.mp3
    #EXTINF:379,Orbital - P.E.T.R.O.L.
    K:\Media\Music\Orbital - In Sides\02-P.E.T.R.O.L..mp3
    #EXTINF:1437,Orbital - Dwr Budr
    K:\Media\Music\Orbital - In Sides\05-Dwr Budr.mp3

4.1 Genarating Winamp playlist in mIRC

    You can call the ViewPl alias (Can be called seperatly from WA_Link e.g /viewpl), which saves the 
    playlist and displays it in a custom window with some pop-ups to jump to or find a track, and add 
    tracks.  The method we used to save the playlist was that I used the $filter command to save all the 
    lines except the first one and those that did NOT contain the #EXTINF (In other words, I saved only 
    the #EXTINF lines) into a temporary file called playlist.tmp.  Then I process that temporary file 
    line by line to make it look like I wanted to.  You can view this code in the alias called SavePl 
    (As with ViewPl it is not actually part of the WA_Link alias e.g /savepl, even though both can
    be called as a /wa viewpl/savepl command).

    A sample playlist.txt stored in the WA_Link folder that contains only 3 tracks might look as follows 
    after ViewPL alias has generated it from the Winamp default playlist (see section 4.0): 

    1. Orbital - The Girl With The Sun In Her Head [24:20]
    2. Orbital - P.E.T.R.O.L. [6:19]
    3. Orbital - Dwr Budr [23:57]

5.0 Sample WA Link addon script

    For example if we want to send our stats as our quit message there are multiple 
    ways of doing this. Here are two ways:

      Method 1. Using the DLL:
        This method requires a theme to be in place and the DLL to be available.
        What we do here is if there is no message sent with the quit alias we call the dll 
        (see section 2.0) to return our stats with theme as a quit messege.  

        alias quit {
          ;If no quit message is sent with /quit then use a wa stats in quit message
          if ($1 == $null) {
            ;We call the "original" quit command with the stats as a message
            quit $dll($shortfn($mircdirWA_Link\WA_Link.dll),WA_Link_Stats,$shortfn($mircdirWA_Link\Themes\Default.ini)
          }
          ;If a quit message is sent with /quit then use that instead
          else {
            quit $1-
          }
        }

     Method 2. Using the WA Link script:
       This method requires the WA Link script to be loaded and the themes to be in place 
       and the DLL to be available.
  
       Here we never call the DLL ourselfs.  We use the power of the WA Link script to get 
       the "normal" command and store it temporarily in a variable, and set the command 
       to /quit.  Then we set the command back after we quit.

       alias quit {
         var %WA.Quit.Temp
         ;If no quit message is sent with /quit then use a wa stats in quit message
         if ($1 == $null) {
           ;Store the normal wa stats command
           set %WA.Quit.Temp %WA.Stats.Command
           ;Overwrite the normal wa stats command with a /quit
           set %WA.Stats.Command /quit
           ;Call the wa stats
           wa stats
           ;Restore the normal wa stats command
           set %WA.Stats.Command %WA.Quit.Temp 
         }
         ;If a quit message is sent with /quit then use that instead 
         elseif ($1 != $null) {
           quit $1-
         }
       }

    Here is another example if we want send a track to other people on a special trigger in a chan. 
    You need to call the DLL for raw info to get the current track filename (see section 2.3). The trigger 
    is !waget and when someone says it in a channel this script sends the current track to that person.
  
      on *:TEXT:!waget:#: {
        var %WA.Trackfilename.Temp  
        set %WA.Trackfilename.Temp $shortfn($dll($shortfn($mircdirWA_Link\WA_Link.dll),WA_Link_Raw_Stats,TRACKFILENAME))
        dcc send $nick %WA.Trackfilename.Temp
      }

    If you want to have two themes selected, and use a single alias to display either of them, the 
    following example could be used:
    
      alias Stats {
        var %Temp

        ; If no parameter is sent along, then we want to set the themes
        if $1 == $null {
          ; Select theme number 1
          set %Temp $sfile($mircdirwa_Link\Themes\,Pick theme 1, Set theme 1)
          if (%Temp != $null) {
            set %Theme1 $shortfn(%Temp)
          }

          ; Select theme number 2
          set %Temp $sfile($mircdirwa_Link\Themes\,Pick theme 2, Set theme 2)
          if (%Temp != $null) {
            set %Theme2 $shortfn(%Temp)
          }
        }
        ; Else we want to call the WA_Link_Stats function with the choosen themes
        else {
          if ($$1 == 1) {
            ; Call the WA_Link_Stats function with the choosen themes
            %WA.Stats.Command $dll($shortfn($mircdirWA_Link\WA_Link.dll),WA_Link_Stats,%Theme1)
          }
          elseif ($$1 == 2) {
            %WA.Stats.Command $dll($shortfn($mircdirWA_Link\WA_Link.dll),WA_Link_Stats,%Theme2)
          }
        }
      }

    Of course the power of WA Link enables you to do much much more. If you make a cool Addon for WA Link
    please send it to us (base@base.is) so we might put it up on our website. (http://www.base.is/thecrew/)

    NOTE: These are just examples, but they work.

6.0 WA Link DLL general information

    The WA Link DLL was written in Delphi 5 Enterprise but it should compile under other 
    versions of Delphi. It has 62 functions and just 6 of them exported. This is done
    to simplify mIRC scripting, since scripters would just be calling 6 functions with 
    different parameters.
      
    Q: Delphi! Why wasn't the WA Link DLL made in C/C++ a real programming language? 
    A: Why not? It works doesn't it! Delphi isn't all just forms and databases, it can 
       also do cool stuff like games, winamp plugins, mIRC DLL's and much more. 
       Ofcourse we could have made the WA_Link.dll in C/C++ like most others mIRC DLL's 
       out there. But what is the fun in doing stuff like everyone else?
       
    If you add/modify the WA_Link.dll and decide to send it to us, please comment what 
    changes you made so we can review them and include it in future versions.

    TIP! It's a good idea to set the output dir to your WA_Link dir under
    mIRC, that way you don't have to copy the DLL file there everytime you recompile.

6.1 WA Link DLL Exported functions

    The following functions are exported:

      LoadDll           - Loads the DLL
      UnloadDll         - Unloads the DLL
      WA_Link_About     - Display the about dialog
      WA_Link_Stats     - Returns current track info in selected theme format
      WA_Link_Command   - Command Winamp to do something, based on data sent with the function
      WA_Link_Raw_Stats - Get raw info from WA Link, based on data sent with the function

    Check section 2.0 for information about calling functions in mIRC

6.2 Adding an exported function

    Too add a exported function so it can be called from mIRC requires the function
    to have special parameters. See below:

    function FunctionName(mWnd: hWnd; aWnd: hWnd; Data: PChar; Parms: PChar;
    Show: Boolean; NoPause: Boolean ): Integer; export; stdcall; 

    (From mIRC help)
    mWnd    - Is the handle to the main mIRC window.
    aWnd    - Is the handle of the window in which the command is being issued, this 
              might not be the currently active window if the command is being called 
              by a remote script.
    data    - Is the information that you wish to send to the DLL. On return, the DLL can 
              fill this variable with the command it wants mIRC to perform if any.
    parms   - Is filled by the DLL on return with parameters that it wants mIRC to use when 
              performing the command that it returns in the data variable.
    show    - Is FALSE if the . prefix was specified to make the command quiet, or TRUE otherwise.
    Nopause - is TRUE if mIRC is in a critical routine and the DLL must not do anything that 
              pauses processing in mIRC, eg. the DLL should not pop up a dialog.             
 
    NOTE: The data and parms variables can each hold 900 chars maximum.
   
    The functin must also return a integer number. This number tells mIRC what 
    to do with the returned data.

    (From mIRC help)
    0 means that mIRC should /halt processing
    1 means that mIRC should continue processing
    2 means that it has filled the data variable with a command which it wants 
      mIRC to perform, and has filled parms with the parameters to use, if any, 
      when performing the command.
    3 means that the DLL has filled the data variable with the result that $dll() 
      as an identifier should return.
   
    You must also add the FunctionName in the exports section at the bottom of the project
    
    exports
    LoadDll,           // Loads the DLL
    UnloadDll,         // Unloads the DLL
    FunctionName;      // <---- Exported function.

7.0 Sample WA_Link.dll exported function

    This exported function commands the winamp window to go to front
    
    function WA_BringToFront(mWnd: hWnd; aWnd: hWnd; Data: PChar; Parms: PChar;
    Show: Boolean; NoPause: Boolean ): Integer; export; stdcall    
    var
      hwndWinamp : thandle;
    
    begin
      hwndWinamp := FindWindow('Winamp v1.x', nil);
      BringWindowToTop(hwndWinamp);
      result := 1;
    end;
   
    This exported function returns the Winamp X,Y coordinates
       
    function WA_GetCoord(mWnd: hWnd; aWnd: hWnd; Data: PChar; Parms: PChar;
    Show: Boolean; NoPause: Boolean ): Integer; export; stdcall    
    var
      hwndWinamp : thandle;
      AreaRect   : TRect;
      Coords     : PChar;
       
    begin
      hwndWinamp := FindWindow('Winamp v1.x', nil);
   
      GetWindowRect(hwndWinamp,AreaRect);
   
      Coords := PChar('x:'+inttostr(AreaRect.Left) + ' y:' + inttostr(AreaRect.Top));

      strcopy(data, Coords);
      result := 3; 
    end; 
   
    NOTE: Remember to add functions in exports section. See Section 6.2

WA Link is a freeware and everyone are free to distribute it and to use WA_Link 
(.dll or .mrc) as they see fit, without having to include any of the original
files or credits. But if you decide to distribute a modified WA_Link (.dll or .mrc)
an E-mail would be very much appreciated (base@base.is).

Even though this addon should not be able to damage anything in your or other computers,
we cannot be held responsible if so unlikely this would happen. This addon is provided 
"as is" and is to be used on the users own responsibilty.
