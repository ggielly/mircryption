; super slapper script, v1.0.10
; 09/14/03
;
; superslapper is a mirc dialog-based addon that lets you apply random
;  and custom slaps to people (extends mirc's built in command that
;  generates the line "/me slaps xxx around a bit with a large trout").
;
; to install:
;  just copy the entire SuperSlapper directory to your mirc directory, and
;   from inside mirc type /load -rs SuperSlapper\superslapper.mrc
;
; To slap someone, right click on their nick, and choose to superslap them.
;
; Or you can use the following manual commands:
;   /slap NICK to do a random slap, presenting dialog for confirmation.
;   /slapc NICK to do a random slap with clipboard object, presenting dialog for confirmation.
;   /slaps NICK to do a random slap without confirmation dialog.
;   /slapall NICK to do a random slap of all users in chan.
;   /slapallops NICK to do a random slap of all ops in chan.
;   /slapallnonops NICK to do a random slap of all non-ops in chan.
;
; about slap data files:
;   you can edit superslapper_slaplines.txt to add your own slap insults.
;    optionally use _nick and _me and _obj1 and _obj2 etc. to define words to replace.
;   you can edit superslapper_objects.txt to define new objects which can replace _obj?
;   you can include blank lines and comments (start comments with //)
;
; you can also have multiple slaplines and object files, and you can switch
;  between them in the dialog, useful if you want to have a file of nice
;  things to say to your sweetheart :)
; just make sure the files are named *lines*.txt and *objects*.txt,
;  and put them somewhere in the same dir or a subdir of the script.
;
; you can launch your default editor for the currently selected slapfiles
;  using the Edit button in the super slap dialog; after editing a file,
;  click refresh to reload the data from a modified file.
