mIRC v5.91/v6.03/v6.1/v6.12/v6.14 FISH-Addon v1.25 [History]
************************************************************



20.04.2004:	v1.25
		  If you already patched your mIRC executable,
		  you DO NOT have to do it again!
		  #### Replace only FiSH.DLL and FiSH.mrc ####

		- new Diffie-Hellman key-exchange implementation:
		  DH1080 - using a 1080 bit prime (the old DH1024
		  is partly left for downward compatibility, so
		  that you are NOT able to *start* a DH1024 key-
		  exchange, but only answer a DH1024 key-exchange
		  request from someone else!)
		  Read more about this issue in FiSH.txt!

		- decrypting ACTION messages now works correctly

		- new feature: mark outgoing (now you are able
		  to see if your own text is sent encrypted). For
		  maximum compatibility I recommend you to disable
		  this feature. You can change the look by editing
		  FiSH.mrc; search for %my_own_encrypted_text



07.03.2004:	v1.24
		- support for mIRC v6.14
		
		- stupid decryption bug fixed! (big parts of psyBNC
		  logs got not decrypted and 2-5% of normal traffic)

		- now decrypting "Mircryption" messages, those start
		  with 'mcps' instead of '+OK' - you can find
		  Mircryption at http://mircryption.sourceforge.net

		- another rare crash (which was introduced in v1.22)
		  fixed!



23.01.2004:	v1.23
		- another decryption bug fixed, occurred only with
		  non IRC-RFC compliant servers (namely: BNC from
		  http://www.gotbnc.com)



22.01.2004:	v1.22
		- evil crash during DH1024 key-exchange fixed!

		- very rare decryption bug (hopefully) fixed!
		  (happened especially while psyBNC log decryption)

		- new options 'encrypt NOTICE' and 'encrypt ACTION'
		  added, available in the popup menu. Decryption of
		  both will take place, no matter you have them
		  enabled or disabled.



14.10.2003:	v1.21
		- new option 'mark_position' added to blow.ini
		  You can choose the position of the crypt-mark
		  via the popup menu now (see FiSH.txt for
		  discription and examples)

		- If you receive a DH1024 public key, a query
		  window will get opened automatically to avoid
		  'double-keyXchange'

		- using GetModuleFileName now to retrieve blow.ini
		  path, instead of GetCurrentDirectory

		- two mIRC exports added for script developers:
		  FiSH_decrypt_msg and FiSH_encrypt_msg

		- improved wrong key handling: no more garbage in
		  status window while decrypting (broken) messages



18.09.2003:	v1.2a
		minor changes in FiSH.mrc:
		- Auto-KeyXchange added (you can enable/disable
		  it in the context menu)
		- you can see the current plain-prefix in
		  the context menu now



31.08.2003:	v1.2
		- Old Diffie-Hellman 128bit key-exchange
		  replaced with 1024bit version. Make sure you
		  read "Security Info" in FiSH.txt

		- Diffie-Hellman 1024bit keyXchange is now
		  available as a standalone mIRC script.



15.05.2003:	v1.1
		- all functions are now located in FiSH.DLL
		  (you can delete all unneeded DLL files:
		  DH.dll, blowfish.dll, libeay32.dll)



12.05.2003:	v1.0a
		- plain-prefix added

		- you can set mark_encrypted=1/0 for each
		  channel/person now (edit blow.ini manually)

		  blow.ini example:
		  ------------------
		  [FiSH]
		  process_incoming=1
		  process_outgoing=1
		  mark_encrypted=" *"
		  plain_prefix="+p "

		  [#yourchan]
		  key=+OK wH.at\EvEr
		  mark_encrypted=0
		  ------------------

		  In this case mark will be skipped ONLY for
		  #yourchan



11.05.2003:	v1.0
		first release
