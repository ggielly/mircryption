                           ******* IMPORTANT ******* 
*****************************************************************************
You only install this serverbot if you want to run a news server on your
local mirc machine!  normally the news bot will be run from an eggdrop script
on a shell.  This local bot is included for those who want to use the news
bot in a channel without a shell/bot user.

INSTALLING AND USING THE NEWS SERVER BOT
1.The mcboard.mrc script basically just provides some easy menu-based commands
  for interacting with an mcboad news BOT which must be installed by someone
  on the channels you are on. Typically this bot will run as an eggdtop bot
  on a shell, but in this package you will also find mcboardbot.mrc which will
  allow you to run a news bot locally, integrated into your mirc.
2.To install the local mirc news server bot, copy the files from this
  subdirectory (newsboard.exe, mcboardbot.mrc,stdio.dll) into your mirc
  directory, and type /load -rs mcboardbot.mrc from mirc.  And have people
  condifure YOUR NICK as the news bot for the channel.  This script will
  now respond to all news requests sent to it by you or anyone else.
