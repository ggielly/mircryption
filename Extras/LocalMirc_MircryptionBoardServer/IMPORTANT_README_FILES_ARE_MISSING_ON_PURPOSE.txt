Due to false virus alarms (first from mcafee, then when that was resolved,
 norton got in on the fun), we have decided to no longer package the stdio.*
 files.  If you want the source code for stdio.dll, which is a dll used by the
 newsboard script to execute an exe and pipe in the output, grab it from
 Dragonzap's homepage (includes full source):

Or from the donationcoder.com site:
