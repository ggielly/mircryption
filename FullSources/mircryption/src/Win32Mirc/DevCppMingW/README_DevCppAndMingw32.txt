This directory contains a dev-c++ project for building the mircryption
 dll with ming32 and a traditional makefile for building it with ming32
 from the commandline.

Getting mircyrption to build with ming32 (which was a bit tricky) was done by
 Joergen Ibsen (www.ibsensoftware.com).  Thanks jibz.
 
Just load the .dev project file into dev-c++ or run make with makefile.mgw
